## What is AutoCAD LT?
 
AutoCAD LT is a professional-grade 2D drafting and documentation software that lets you create precise drawings with intuitive tools and commands. You can use AutoCAD LT to:
 
- Draw and edit geometry with accuracy and efficiency
- Annotate drawings with text, dimensions, leaders, and tables
- Customize your workspace with tool palettes, ribbons, and menus
- Share your drawings with clients and collaborators using DWG format
- Access online storage and web and mobile apps for anytime, anywhere work

## What is Revit LT?
 
Revit LT is a simplified 3D BIM software that helps you create high-quality architectural designs and documentation. You can use Revit LT to:

- Create 3D models of buildings and structures with parametric components
- Generate floor plans, elevations, sections, and 3D views automatically from the model
- Add materials, lighting, and rendering effects to visualize your design
- Create schedules, sheets, and annotations to document your design
- Co-ordinate changes across your model and drawings with automatic updates
- Import and export DWG files to collaborate with AutoCAD users

## How do AutoCAD LT and Revit LT work together?
 
AutoCAD Revit LT Suite 2019 gives you the flexibility to work with both 2D and 3D design tools in a single package. You can use AutoCAD LT to create and edit 2D drawings, and then import them into Revit LT to create 3D models. Alternatively, you can use Revit LT to create 3D models, and then export them to AutoCAD LT to create 2D drawings. You can also use both applications to work on different aspects of the same project, such as conceptual design, detailing, or documentation.
 
## What are the benefits of AutoCAD Revit LT Suite 2019?
 
AutoCAD Revit LT Suite 2019 offers several advantages for architectural design professionals, such as:

- A cost-effective solution that gives you access to two industry-leading software applications for a fraction of the price of standalone subscriptions
- A streamlined workflow that allows you to work with both 2D and 3D design tools in a consistent and compatible way
- A competitive edge that helps you qualify and win projects that require BIM deliverables or collaboration
- A learning curve that is easy to manage with familiar tools and commands in both applications
- A support network that provides you with expert advice, online resources, and community forums
